# üíª React Native Jobs App

In this documentation, I share my learning experience from the Javascript Mastery Youtube Channel by building a mobile application called React Native Jobs using React Native and Expo. The application will be a simple job listing app that allows users to browse and search for jobs.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- [Rapid API : JSearch](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTJ1bnJid3BISkE1dmZPalhpWlEwc2F6NVkxQXxBQ3Jtc0tuNzRydUxDRktWRTlSSUlxU1JaWmtmSmpkdTdzRDQ4akd3UGY4alVSWW1DTEVJaGRURlJ4SXJNSTMteVpwbEpTdjdkSzVGUWQtN0NZeFNWd1lhS3JYeVNVUVVjMV9PRFpoU0dYS3QyY1BBUkM2ay1OQQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Frapidapi.com%2Fletscrape-6bRBa3QguO5%2Fapi%2Fjsearch%3Futm_source%3Dyoutube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DDevRel&v=mJ3bGvy0WAY)
## üìç Features

The application has the following features
- Users can browse a list of jobs.
- Users can search for jobs by title, company, or location.
- Users can view the details of a job.
- Users can filter job results by job category, such as full-time, part-time, and contract.
- Users can apply for jobs


## üßë‚ÄçüíªMy Learning Process
I followed a tutorial from the Javascript Mastery Youtube Channel to learn the basics of React Native development. However, I had to make some adjustments to the code due to differences in the current version of Expo from the version used in the tutorial.

### üîë Key Learnings from this project
- Developing visually appealing UI/UX designs
- Fetching data from an external API and integrating it into the app
- Implementing search and pagination functionality
- Creating custom API data fetching hooks
- Writing clean, organized, and maintainable code with proper architecture
- Following the best practices for React Native development

### üõú Additional Resources
In addition to the tutorial, I also referred to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) to learn more about the specific features used in the project.

### üí™ Challenges Faced
One of the challenges I faced was understanding the differences between the current version of Expo and the version used in the tutorial. This required me to spend some time researching and debugging the code.

### üìà Overall Experience:
Overall, I found the learning process to be very rewarding. I was able to learn a lot about React Native with Expo Router development and apply my learnings to create a functional and visually appealing app.

## Run Locally
